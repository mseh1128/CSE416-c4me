## Reflection

This project was undertaken during Spring 2020 as the final project for CSE 416 (Software Engineering). I've already had extensive experience with these technologies prior to this project. Thus, my main goals for this project were to learn how to collaborate with others and just write good, clean, modularized code.  

Due to time constraints, many quality of life issues changes could not be implemented. Unit testing, config files, optimized database schemas/queries, a more aesthetically pleasing UI and easier deployment options are some potential improvements.
